# 🚀 Reinforcement Learning: Multi-Armed Bandit Experiments

This repository contains **modular implementations** of **stationary multi-armed bandit algorithms**, inspired by Sutton & Barto’s *Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction*. The project is structured to support **parameter tuning, experimentation, and visualization** of different bandit algorithms (Greedy, Epsilon-Greedy, UCB, Gradient Bandit, and Thompson Sampling)
